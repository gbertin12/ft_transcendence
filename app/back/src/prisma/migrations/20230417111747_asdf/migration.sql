/*
  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `User` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - You are about to drop the column `password` on the `User` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `role` on the `User` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `username` on the `User` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - A unique constraint covering the columns `[id]` on the table `User` will be added. If there are existing duplicate values, this will fail.
  - Added the required column `login` to the `User` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
